Each command should be tested with following scenarios of execution:
  - with required parameters only
  - with all parameters used (if possible as some may be mutually exclusive)
  - with --apiKey parameter used
  - using wrong apiKey - with patched response from API
  - API returned error with message in JSON
  - API returned error without JSON
  - check if mutual exclusion of parameters works as expected
