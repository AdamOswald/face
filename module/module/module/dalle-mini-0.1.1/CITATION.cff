abstract: "DALL·E mini is a JAX/Flax reimplementation of OpenAI's DALL·E that requires much smaller hardware resources. By simplifying the architecture and model memory requirements, as well as leveraging open-source code and pre-trained models, we were able to create a model that is 27 times smaller than the original DALL·E and train it on a single TPU v3-8 for only 3 days. DALL·E mini achieves impressive results, albeit of a lower quality than the original system. It can be used for exploration and further experimentation on commodity hardware."
