This project trains a computer program to identify a voice as male or female, based upon acoustic properties of the voice and speech. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers. The voice samples are pre-processed by acoustic analysis in R and then processed with artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms to learn gender-specific traits for classifying the voice as male or female.

The best model achieves an accuracy of 100% on the training set and 89% on the test set.

**Update: By narrowing the frequency range analyzed to 0hz-280hz ([human vocal range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_frequency#Fundamental_frequency)), the best accuracy is boosted to 100%/99%.**

## The Dataset

Download the pre-processed [dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/primaryobjects/voice-gender/master/voice.csv) as a CSV file.

The CSV file contains the following fields:

"meanfreq","sd","median","Q25","Q75","IQR","skew","kurt","sp.ent","sfm","mode","centroid","meanfun","minfun","maxfun","meandom","mindom","maxdom","dfrange","modindx","label"

"label" corresponds to the gender classification of the sample. The remaining fields are acoustic properties, detailed [below](#acoustic-properties-measured).

In R, you can load the dataset file [data.bin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/primaryobjects/voice-gender/master/data.bin) directly as a data.frame with the command ```load('data.bin')```.

In addition to the pre-processed dataset, the raw voice samples used for training are included as .WAV files in a separate repository. The .WAV files are pre-processed in R to produce the above dataset.

## Accuracy

The trained models have achieved the following accuracies (train/test):

#### Baseline Algorithm (always male)
50%/50%

#### Baseline Algorithm (simple frequency threshold)
61%/59%

#### Logistic Regression
72%/71%

#### Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
81%/78%

#### Random Forest
100%/87%

#### Generalized Boosted Tree Regression
91%/84%

#### XGBoost
100%/87%

#### XGBoost (Updated with frequency range 0hz-280hz)
100%/99%

## Acoustic Properties Measured

The following acoustic properties of each voice are measured:

- **duration**: length of signal
- **meanfreq**: mean frequency (in kHz)
- **sd**: standard deviation of frequency
- **median**: median frequency (in kHz)
- **Q25**: first quantile (in kHz)
- **Q75**: third quantile (in kHz)
- **IQR**: interquantile range (in kHz)
- **skew**: skewness (see note in specprop description)
- **kurt**: kurtosis (see note in specprop description)
- **sp.ent**: spectral entropy
- **sfm**: spectral flatness
- **mode**: mode frequency
- **centroid**: frequency centroid (see specprop)
- **peakf**: peak frequency (frequency with highest energy)
- **meanfun**: average of fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
- **minfun**: minimum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
- **maxfun**: maximum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal
- **meandom**: average of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
- **mindom**: minimum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
- **maxdom**: maximum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
- **dfrange**: range of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal
- **modindx**: modulation index. Calculated as the accumulated absolute difference between adjacent measurements of fundamental frequencies divided by the frequency range

## Classification and Regression Decision Tree

The following decision tree, produced by the CART model, provides a high-level overview of important properties of the voice samples that may determine a specific gender classification of male versus female.

After narrowing the frequency range to 0hz-280hz with a sound threshold of 15%, the accuracy is boosted to near perfect, and the following CART model is described. Mean fundamental frequency serves as a powerful indicator of voice gender, with a threshold of 140hz separating male from female classifications.
