<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>

## Simple Art style transferer
You give a style image and the model learns the features and transfers it to the content image
Best recommended to run with a GPU for fastest result

## How it works?

Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images, style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter), and the input image you want to style

The model then blends the images to give your input image a artistic style

## How to run locally?

#### Clone the repo.
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/Rohith04MVK/AI-Art-Generator
```

#### Setup conda.
```sh
conda create -n AI-Art-Generator python=3.8.5
```
```sh
conda activate AI-Art-Generator
```


#### Install dependancies.

```sh
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
#### OR
```sh
conda install --file requirement.txt
```

#### Replace the pictures.
Replace line 10  `content_path` with the image you want to transform
Replace line 11 `style_path` with the style picture you want to transfer

#### Run the file!
```sh
python aiart.py
```
