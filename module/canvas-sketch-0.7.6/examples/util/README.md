# util

:warning:

This is still very experimental and likely to change and/or be removed. Eventually it will be published as a separate module, that can be used with or without `canvas-sketch`, and handle utilities around:

- Randomness (range, shuffling, gaussian, weighted, etc)
- Math (lerp, smoothstep, etc)
- Geometry (line resampling, collision detection, etc)
- Color (palettes, contrast, etc)
- Animation (tween, easing, curves, etc)
- Canvas2D (convenience functions for rendering)
- WebGL (high-level 2D/3D geometry wrappers)
- GUI (dat.gui-like convenience utils, etc)
