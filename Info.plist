Sentiment Analysis with XGBoost on Algorithmia
1. Train, evaluate and test XGBoost model
In [ ]:
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

from string import punctuation
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

from xgboost import XGBClassifier
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import joblib
Load the training data

Let's load our training data, take a look at a few rows and one of the review texts in detail.

In [ ]:
data = pd.read_csv("./data/amazon_musical_reviews/Musical_instruments_reviews.csv")
data.head()
In [ ]:
data["reviewText"].iloc[1]
Preprocessing

Time to process our texts! Basically, we'll:

Remove the English stopwords
Remove punctuations
Drop unused columns
In [ ]:
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')

def threshold_ratings(data):
    def threshold_overall_rating(rating):
        return 0 if int(rating)<=3 else 1
    data["overall"] = data["overall"].apply(threshold_overall_rating)

def remove_stopwords_punctuation(data):
    data["review"] = data["reviewText"] + data["summary"]

    puncs = list(punctuation)
    stops = stopwords.words("english")

    def remove_stopwords_in_str(input_str):
        filtered = [char for char in str(input_str).split() if char not in stops]
        return ' '.join(filtered)

    def remove_punc_in_str(input_str):
        filtered = [char for char in input_str if char not in puncs]
        return ''.join(filtered)

    def remove_stopwords_in_series(input_series):
        text_clean = []
        for i in range(len(input_series)):
            text_clean.append(remove_stopwords_in_str(input_series[i]))
        return text_clean

    def remove_punc_in_series(input_series):
        text_clean = []
        for i in range(len(input_series)):
            text_clean.append(remove_punc_in_str(input_series[i]))
        return text_clean

    data["review"] = remove_stopwords_in_series(data["review"].str.lower())
    data["review"] = remove_punc_in_series(data["review"].str.lower())

def drop_unused_colums(data):
    data.drop(['reviewerID', 'asin', 'reviewerName', 'helpful', 'unixReviewTime', 'reviewTime', "reviewText", "summary"], axis=1, inplace=True)

def preprocess_reviews(data):
    remove_stopwords_punctuation(data)
    threshold_ratings(data)
    drop_unused_colums(data)
In [ ]:
preprocess_reviews(data)
data.head()
Split our training and test sets
In [ ]:
rand_seed = 42
X = data["review"]
y = data["overall"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=rand_seed)
Mini randomized search

Let's set up a very basic cross-validated randomized search over parameter settings.

In [ ]:
params = {"max_depth": range(9,12), "min_child_weight": range(5,8)}
rand_search_cv = RandomizedSearchCV(XGBClassifier(), param_distributions=params, n_iter=1)
Pipeline to vectorize, transform and fit

Time to vectorize our data, transform it and then fit our model to it. To be able to feed the text data as numeric values to our model, we will first convert our texts into a matrix of token counts using a CountVectorizer. Then we will convert the count matrix to a normalized tf-idf (term-frequency times inverse document-frequency) representation. Using this transformer, we will be scaling down the impact of tokens that occur very frequently, because they convey less information to us. On the contrary, we will be scaling up the impact of the tokens that occur in a small fraction of the training data because they are more informative to us.

In [ ]:
model  = Pipeline([
    ('vect', CountVectorizer()),
    ('tfidf', TfidfTransformer()),
    ('model', rand_search_cv)
])
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Predict and calculate accuracy
In [ ]:
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {round(acc * 100, 2)}")
2. Save XGBoost model to a file

We should save the created model object to a local path. The Github action will then take the model object from this path and upload it to Algorithmia.

In [ ]:
joblib.dump(model, "model.pkl", compress=True)
3. Test our serving (Algorithm) code

We will now test our algorithm code, ie. xgboost_automated_github.py script, by simply executing it with the %run macro. The script will begin its execution through our if __name__ == "__main__" line.

In [1]:
%run xgboost_automated_github/src/xgboost_automated_github.py

Preprocessing

Time to process our texts! Basically, we'll:

Remove the English stopwords
Remove punctuations
Drop unused columns

Split our training and test sets
In [ ]:
rand_seed = 42

y = data["overall"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=rand_seed)
Mini randomized search

Let's set up a very basic cross-validated randomized search over parameter settings.

In [ ]:
params = {"max_depth": range(9,12), "min_child_weight": range(5,8)}
rand_search_cv = RandomizedSearchCV(XGBClassifier(), param_distributions=params, n_iter=1)
Pipeline to vectorize, transform and fit

Time to vectorize our data, transform it and then fit our model to it. To be able to feed the text data as numeric values to our model, we will first convert our texts into a matrix of token counts using a CountVectorizer. Then we will convert the count matrix to a normalized tf-idf (term-frequency times inverse document-frequency) representation. Using this transformer, we will be scaling down the impact of tokens that occur very frequently, because they convey less information to us. On the contrary, we will be scaling up the impact of the tokens that occur in a small fraction of the training data because they are more informative to us.

In [ ]:
model  = Pipeline([
    ('vect', CountVectorizer()),
    ('tfidf', TfidfTransformer()),
    ('model', rand_search_cv)
])
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Predict and calculate accuracy
In [ ]:
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {round(acc * 100, 2)}")
2. Save XGBoost model to a file

We should save the created model object to a local path. The Github action will then take the model object from this path and upload it to Algorithmia.

In [ ]:
joblib.dump(model, "model.pkl", compress=True)
3. Test our serving (Algorithm) code

We will now test our algorithm code, ie. xgboost_automated.py script, by simply executing it with the %run macro. The script will begin its execution through our if __name__ == "__main__" line.

In [ ]:
%run xgboost_automated/src/xgboost_automated.py
Final checks before committing this notebook

Make sure xgboost_automated.py file is in good shape to be pushed to Algorithmia.

Make sure Algorithmia API Key is not committed and pushed in any file!

Sentiment Analysis with XGBoost on Algorithmia
1. Train, evaluate and test XGBoost model
In [ ]:
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

from string import punctuation
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

from xgboost import XGBClassifier
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import joblib
Load the training data

Let's load our training data, take a look at a few rows and one of the review texts in detail.

In [ ]:
data = pd.read_csv("./data/amazon_musical_reviews/Musical_instruments_reviews.csv")
data.head()
In [ ]:
data["reviewText"].iloc[1]
Preprocessing

Time to process our texts! Basically, we'll:

Remove the English stopwords
Remove punctuations
Drop unused columns
In [ ]:
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')

def threshold_ratings(data):
    def threshold_overall_rating(rating):
        return 0 if int(rating)<=3 else 1
    data["overall"] = data["overall"].apply(threshold_overall_rating)

def remove_stopwords_punctuation(data):
    data["review"] = data["reviewText"] + data["summary"]

    puncs = list(punctuation)
    stops = stopwords.words("english")

    def remove_stopwords_in_str(input_str):
        filtered = [char for char in str(input_str).split() if char not in stops]
        return ' '.join(filtered)

    def remove_punc_in_str(input_str):
        filtered = [char for char in input_str if char not in puncs]
        return ''.join(filtered)

    def remove_stopwords_in_series(input_series):
        text_clean = []
        for i in range(len(input_series)):
            text_clean.append(remove_stopwords_in_str(input_series[i]))
        return text_clean

    def remove_punc_in_series(input_series):
        text_clean = []
        for i in range(len(input_series)):
            text_clean.append(remove_punc_in_str(input_series[i]))
        return text_clean

    data["review"] = remove_stopwords_in_series(data["review"].str.lower())
    data["review"] = remove_punc_in_series(data["review"].str.lower())

def drop_unused_colums(data):
    data.drop(['reviewerID', 'asin', 'reviewerName', 'helpful', 'unixReviewTime', 'reviewTime', "reviewText", "summary"], axis=1, inplace=True)

def preprocess_reviews(data):
    remove_stopwords_punctuation(data)
    threshold_ratings(data)
    drop_unused_colums(data)
In [ ]:
preprocess_reviews(data)
data.head()
Split our training and test sets
In [ ]:
rand_seed = 42
X = data["review"]
y = data["overall"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=rand_seed)
Mini randomized search

Let's set up a very basic cross-validated randomized search over parameter settings.

In [ ]:
params = {"max_depth": range(9,12), "min_child_weight": range(5,8)}
rand_search_cv = RandomizedSearchCV(XGBClassifier(), param_distributions=params, n_iter=1)
Pipeline to vectorize, transform and fit

Time to vectorize our data, transform it and then fit our model to it. To be able to feed the text data as numeric values to our model, we will first convert our texts into a matrix of token counts using a CountVectorizer. Then we will convert the count matrix to a normalized tf-idf (term-frequency times inverse document-frequency) representation. Using this transformer, we will be scaling down the impact of tokens that occur very frequently, because they convey less information to us. On the contrary, we will be scaling up the impact of the tokens that occur in a small fraction of the training data because they are more informative to us.

In [ ]:
model  = Pipeline([
    ('vect', CountVectorizer()),
    ('tfidf', TfidfTransformer()),
    ('model', rand_search_cv)
])
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Predict and calculate accuracy
In [ ]:
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {round(acc * 100, 2)}")
2. Save XGBoost model to a file

We should save the created model object to a local path. The Github action will then take the model object from this path and upload it to Algorithmia.

In [ ]:
joblib.dump(model, "model.pkl", compress=True)
3. Test our serving (Algorithm) code

We will now test our algorithm code, ie. xgboost_automated_github.py script, by simply executing it with the %run macro. The script will begin its execution through our if __name__ == "__main__" line.

In [1]:
%run xgboost_automated_github/src/xgboost_automated_github.py

Sentiment Analysis with XGBoost on Algorithmia
1. Train, evaluate and test XGBoost model
In [ ]:
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

from string import punctuation
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

from xgboost import XGBClassifier
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import joblib
Load the training data

Let's load our training data, take a look at a few rows and one of the review texts in detail.

In [ ]:
data = pd.read_csv("./data/amazon_musical_reviews/Musical_instruments_reviews.csv")
data.head()
In [ ]:
data["reviewText"].iloc[1]
Preprocessing

Time to process our texts! Basically, we'll:

Remove the English stopwords
Remove punctuations
Drop unused columns
In [ ]:
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')

def threshold_ratings(data):
    def threshold_overall_rating(rating):
        return 0 if int(rating)<=3 else 1
    data["overall"] = data["overall"].apply(threshold_overall_rating)

def remove_stopwords_punctuation(data):
    data["review"] = data["reviewText"] + data["summary"]

    puncs = list(punctuation)
    stops = stopwords.words("english")

    def remove_stopwords_in_str(input_str):
        filtered = [char for char in str(input_str).split() if char not in stops]
        return ' '.join(filtered)

    def remove_punc_in_str(input_str):
        filtered = [char for char in input_str if char not in puncs]
        return ''.join(filtered)

    def remove_stopwords_in_series(input_series):
        text_clean = []

        return text_clean

    data["review"] = remove_stopwords_in_series(data["review"].str.lower())
    data["review"] = remove_punc_in_series(data["review"].str.lower())

def drop_unused_colums(data):
    data.drop(['reviewerID', 'asin', 'reviewerName', 'helpful', 'unixReviewTime', 'reviewTime', "reviewText", "summary"], axis=1, inplace=True)

data.head()
Split our training and test sets
In [ ]:
rand_seed = 42
X = data["review"]
y = data["overall"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=rand_seed)
Mini randomized search

Let's set up a very basic cross-validated randomized search over parameter settings.

In [ ]:
params = {"max_depth": range(9,12), "min_child_weight": range(5,8)}
rand_search_cv = RandomizedSearchCV(XGBClassifier(), param_distributions=params, n_iter=1)
Pipeline to vectorize, transform and fit

Time to vectorize our data, transform it and then fit our model to it. To be able to feed the text data as numeric values to our model, we will first convert our texts into a matrix of token counts using a CountVectorizer. Then we will convert the count matrix to a normalized tf-idf (term-frequency times inverse document-frequency) representation. Using this transformer, we will be scaling down the impact of tokens that occur very frequently, because they convey less information to us. On the contrary, we will be scaling up the impact of the tokens that occur in a small fraction of the training data because they are more informative to us.

In [ ]:
model  = Pipeline([
    ('vect', CountVectorizer()),
    ('tfidf', TfidfTransformer()),
    ('model', rand_search_cv)
])
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Predict and calculate accuracy
In [ ]:
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {round(acc * 100, 2)}")
2. Save XGBoost model to a file

We should save the created model object to a local path. The Github action will then take the model object from this path and upload it to Algorithmia.

In [ ]:
joblib.dump(model, "model.pkl", compress=True)
3. Test our serving (Algorithm) code

We will now test our algorithm code, ie. xgboost_automated.py script, by simply executing it with the %run macro. The script will begin its execution through our if __name__ == "__main__" line.

In [ ]:
%run xgboost_automated/src/xgboost_automated.py
Final checks before committing this notebook

Make sure xgboost_automated.py file is in good shape to be pushed to Algorithmia.

Make sure Algorithmia API Key is not committed and pushed in any file!
