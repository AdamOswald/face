    This object can be used to serve as a proxy on an object where we want to
    forward all function calls along to the dependent object, but only when
    some condition is true. For example, the primary use case for this object
    is to deal with that fact that in a distributed training job, we only want
    to manage artifacts (checkpoints, logs, TB summaries) on the rank-0
    process.

    So, let's say that we have this class:
    ```
    class Foo:
        def bar(self, val):
            pass

        def baz(self, val1, val2):
            pass
    ```

    and we wrap it with this object:
    ```
    proxy = ConditionalProxy(Foo(), rank == 0)
    proxy.bar(42)
    proxy.baz(10, 20)
    proxy.some_other_function('darn it')  # Throws an exception because `Foo`
                                          # doesn't have an implementation for
                                          # this.
    ```

    In this case, if `rank == 0`, then we will end up calling `Foo.bar` and
    `Foo.baz`.
    If `rank != 0`, then the calls will be ignored.

    In addition to the basic usage, you can also add a `post_hook` to the
    proxy, which is a callable that takes no arguments. The proxy will call
    that function after each function call made through the proxy, but only
    when `condition == True`.
