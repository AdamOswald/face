Data Science experiments centered around Doctor Who datasets by [Matt Eland](https://MattEland.dev)

## ML.NET Experiment

The Machine Learning Experiment is present inside of the `MLNet` folder. Open up `MattEland.ML.WhoML.sln` in Visual Studio 2017+ with .NET 6 installed and run the `MattEland.ML.TimeAndSpace` project to run that application.

## Data Sources

Data taken from [Jeanmidev's Doctor Who dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jeanmidev/doctor-who) includes data from the IMDB dataset as well as the Doctor Who Guide website.

*Note: Script details are also available, but were not chosen for this experiment and are excluded to cut down on extra storage needs*

## Flow

Values are first loaded in [the aggregation notebook](/EDA/WhoAggregation.ipynb) from multiple data files. The resulting dataset is saved as `Merged.csv`.

The [feature extraction notebook](/EDA/WhoFeatureExtraction.ipynb) then extracts meaningful features from that data and saves it into a `Processed.csv` file that can be used for visualization or machine learning.

`WhoFeatureExtraction.ipynb` and `DateFixer.ipynb` exist to introduce new columns to the dataset, but additional manual processing was done in Excel to insert new data for more recent episodes that was not present in the source dataset. As a result, it is not possible to manually generate the final `WhoDataSet.csv` or `WhoDataSetCategorical.csv` files, but this should give insight into how those files were originally formed.
